## About
I build data products that answer business questions and ship ML models that are production-ready. My strengths: data cleaning & wrangling, SQL, exploratory analysis, model building, and deploying models as APIs.

**Primary stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SQL, Power BI, FastAPI, Docker, Streamlit

## Featured Projects
1. **Sales Dashboard (PowerBI) —** interactive dashboard + SQL-backed ETL. *(Repo: Sales-Dashboard-Analytics)*
2. **Loan Default Prediction —** end-to-end ML: EDA → Feature engineering → Model → Dockerized FastAPI. *(Repo: loan-default-prediction)*
3. **SQL-Practice-Problems —** advanced SQL queries, window functions, CTEs, case studies. *(Repo: sql-practice)*
